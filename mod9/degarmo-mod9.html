                For this assignment, create a function titled counter that takes an array 
                of numbers as the parameter. The function is then to return an array 
                holding the numbers of negative elements, zeros, and values greater than 
                zero in the given array parameter.
            </p>
            <p>
                ** Test your code with at least three arrays that you proved. Ideally, 
                the user (me) would see the original array, and then the count.
            </p>

            My interpretation of these instructions is to create an array, count 
            how many of each positive, negative, and zero values there are in 
            the array, and then finally to display those results. I have chosen 
            to randomize the arrays and allow the user to generate them with the 
            click of a button.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can generate arrays by clicking the button below.
