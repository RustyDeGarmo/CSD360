            I used to think that investing was only for rich people. I was living paycheck to paycheck even when I had the means to save some. <span id="first">_______________</span>. I had gotten furloghed from my well paying job and ended up working for about half pay as much as I was used to. I had to travel around 30 miles to my new job, and I was worried about having enough gas money to make it through a month. <span id="second">_____________</span>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Then an interesting thing happened. <span id="third">_________________________</span>. That got me thinking, how was it that I was saving money now when I wasn't before? I was making half as much for crying out loud. And that's when I woke up to the truth about personal finance. <span id="fourth">__________________</span>. This might seem intuitive to some, but it wasn't to me before that day.
